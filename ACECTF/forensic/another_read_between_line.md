Question: Is this another one of those hidden in plain sight typical normie challenges?
Answer: No.

This challenge is very simple, here you have a file named hidden and all you need to do is get the flag. My focus for this year's CTF is not just the beginning but also ending on a high note, I won't rely on overused "read between the line" challenges and would rather have you guys do some research.

Good Luck!
