One of the first things I learnt when I started learning to hack was linux. It was fun until I hit a ceiling of understanding about the differences in Operating Systems, what's a Shell, Kernel, etc.

But once I got better I started developing a liking towards the terminal and how the Linux operating system is better than say Windows, or worse in some cases. How none of them is superior, nor the other inferior. We shall find out with this challenge.

Be careful, a lot of fake galfs around.
